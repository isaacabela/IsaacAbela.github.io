        Cristiano Ronaldo finished the Qatar 2022 World Cup as the member of the Portuguese National Team with the lowest rating after starting two straight games as a substitute, against Switzerland in the Round of 16 and Morocco in the Quarterfinal. This is according to data from SofaScore.

        Ronaldo's tournament got underway with a penalty goal in the exhilarating 3-2 victory over Ghana in the opening round. After that, Portugal defeated Uruguay 2-0. Cristiano Ronaldo came close to scoring in that game, but Bruno Fernandes ended up scoring twice instead.Â They lost to South Korea in the final game of the group stage; the legendary Portuguese player started the game but exited the field after 65 minutes without scoring.

        The athlete was further irritated by substitutions in the first round of the tournament when the Portuguese boss left him off the starting lineup for both the team's crushing victory over the Swiss (6-1) and following defeat to the Moroccans. According to the stats, he finished the World Cup with 1 goal in 291 minutes, 4 important passes, 3 significant opportunities squandered, 1 error that resulted in an opponent goal, and an overall rating of 6.46.
